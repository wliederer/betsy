      <h2>Bills vs. Chiefs: Allen vs. Mahomes in AFC Divisional Clash</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="css-92ucc9">
      <p>
        Hey there, sports fans! Get ready for an epic clash between the Buffalo
        Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional game this Sunday
        at Highmark Stadium. This game is going to be off the charts, especially
        because it features a showdown between two powerhouse quarterbacks -
        Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. The Bills are coming off a solid victory
        against the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the Chiefs displayed their
        dominance by crushing the Miami Dolphins. And let me tell you, Mahomes
        is about to experience his first road playoff game, which adds even more
        intrigue to this matchup! The last time these two teams met in the
        playoffs, it was Mahomes who led the Chiefs to an overtime win. But
        Allen is hungry for revenge and looking to prove himself against Mahomes
        once again.

        Let's talk stats, folks! Both quarterbacks have had amazing seasons.
        Mahomes has thrown for a whopping 4,183 yards and 27 touchdowns, while
        Allen has really turned heads with his 4,306 yards and 29 touchdowns.
        Mahomes has a solid passer rating of 92.6, and Allen is just slightly
        behind with a rating of 92.2. When it comes to rushing, Allen is the
        true dual-threat quarterback, scoring an impressive 15 rushing
        touchdowns this season. On the other hand, Mahomes has yet to find the
        end zone with his legs. The Chiefs heavily rely on their passing game,
        with Mahomes averaging 261.4 passing yards per game, compared to Allen's
        average of 253.3.

        Now, let's dive into the betting odds from BetMGM. The Bills are the
        favorites to win this game with a spread of -3. The moneyline for the
        Bills is -145, while the Chiefs' moneyline is +120. If you're wondering
        about the over/under, it's set at 45.5. Considering the Bills'
        home-field advantage and their recent winning streak, it seems like a
        smart move to put your money on them to cover the spread and emerge
        victorious. Although, keep in mind that the Chiefs boast a strong
        defense that has held their opponents to under 20 points in their last
        three games.

        From a fantasy football perspective, get ready for a high-scoring
        showdown with an explosive offense from both teams. Both Allen and
        Mahomes are solid options at the quarterback position, but Allen has the
        edge thanks to his ability to make plays with his legs. Wide receiver
        Stefon Diggs and tight end Travis Kelce should be on your must-start
        list, as they have been the go-to targets for their respective
        quarterbacks. Running backs Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Devin Singletary
        could also have a big impact, considering that both teams have had their
        struggles defending the run at times.
